# Exercise-Pose-Classification
This project implements an end-to-end exercise classification system using human pose estimation. Exercise videos are converted into frames, pose keypoints are extracted using MediaPipe, and a Keras-based MLP model is trained on landmark features. The trained model is converted to TensorFlow Lite for efficient deployment on edge and mobile devices.
